@ngdoc error
@name ng:areq
@fullName Bad Argument
@description

AngularJS often asserts that certain values will be present and truthy using a
helper function. If the assertion fails, this error is thrown. To fix this problem,
make sure that the value the assertion expects is defined and truthy.

You may be missing referring to this file '@fullName' in your page.
